###File Extractor
This base script is to be used alongside Crontab or Automator to automatically extract and download course files from the web. You can setup a shell script and use it as an alarm in your iCal event to trigger its downloading whenever you want. This is so that you don't have to go to open up the browser, enter some url, click on some tab, and then save the file to a particular destination folder. This script that all that for you, so you only have to open it.

Modify as you like it!
